create a html code for a landing page of the website using tailwind css, make sure it looks good,use black and white color for theme

Q.Why index.html?
Ans. 
1.Default behavior of web servers: Most web servers are configured to look for index.html as the default landing page.
2.Usability: When you type something like example.com, the browser will directly load the index.html file without needing to specify example.com/index.html. This keeps the URL simple and user-friendly.

Q.(2+2) = 4 how in html?

div
#div
.div    All are different

rgba (red,green,blue,alpha)
rgb bcoz our screen is made up of only red green blue
alpha means transparency

#000 ==> black color (r=b=g=0 ==> kuch nhi ==> black color)
#fff ==> white color (r=b=g=at full ==>all mix==> white color,as according to newtons theory of vibgyor)

remember color means the color of the text if any present in div etc
in order to check things like position,size etc, give background color to the div
