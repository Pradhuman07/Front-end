Units:-

1) px :- fixed ... depends on device to device ... for eg , in laptop there are many pixels so 1 px size will be very small ..while in mobile there are less pixels so 1 px size will be large as compared to that on laptops

2) % :- depends on parent element 

3) vh/vw :- depends on screen's height and width  [viewport ht/ viewport width]

        vh,vw are also not good for making the websites as the viewport ht of laptop < viewport width of laptop but in mobile viewport ht > viewport width

4) vmax/vmin :- depends on maximum or minimum viewport 

5) em , rem :- 

6) media queries
