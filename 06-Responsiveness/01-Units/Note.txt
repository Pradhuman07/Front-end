Units:-


I] Absolute :- px,cm,mm etc
II] Relative :- % , vh , vw , (vmax,vmin) , em , rem 

1) px :- fixed ... depends on device to device ... for eg , in laptop there are many pixels so 1 px size will be very small ..while in mobile there are less pixels so 1 px size will be large as compared to that on laptops

2) % :- depends on parent element 

3) vh/vw :- depends on screen's height and width  [viewport ht/ viewport width]

vh,vw are also not good for making the websites as the viewport ht of laptop < viewport width of laptop but in mobile viewport ht > viewport width

4) vmax/vmin :- depends on maximum or minimum viewport 
        • for laptops , vmax = vw , vmin = vh
        • for mobiles , vmax = vh , vmin = vw

5) em , rem :- 

6) media queries :- for changing scripts at certain hts/widths .. used for writing codes for application that need to be on different devices

7) mixin :- scss :- for writing repetitive code
